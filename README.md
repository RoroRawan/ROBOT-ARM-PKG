As i mention at a previous repository called "install-ROS-1-and-ROS-2
" specially at this file "How can I install ROS 1 on Ubuntu" here is the link:

https://github.com/RoroRawan/install-ROS-1-and-ROS-2 what I did is I installed ubuntu through windows powershell via WSLg and after that I installed ROS 1 on it, so not as virtualbox ubuntu version؛ all the file going to installed directelly. what I’m saying is that we have to install linux(file) to downlaod on it all the backages that we need, a long further to do this
#### we are going to:

* "open the ubuntu"
* "type in this cmd:

'''
 sudo apt install nautilus -y
'''
